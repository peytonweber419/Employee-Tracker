# Employee-Tracker
Here I have developed a command-line application to manage a company's employee database. This allows the user to view the departments, roles, and employees in the database while also providing functionality to create new departments, roles, and employees. I used JavaScript, Node.js, npm, Inquirer, and MySQL to create this application. 

## Installation and Usage

- Clone the repository onto your computer,
- Right click the server.js file in the root of the repo and open in integrated terminal,
- Run `nnpm install` to download inquirer and mysql,
- Run `node.server.js` in the terminal to start the application,
- Follow the instructions in the prompts!
